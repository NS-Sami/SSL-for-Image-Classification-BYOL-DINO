## Assignment Overview

### Purpose and Motivation

In Assignment 01 you trained CNN and Transformer-based models—MobileNetV3, EfficientNet-
B3, ResNeXt-50, ViT, Swin, and DeiT—on your group’s assigned image dataset using fully
supervised learning. While powerful, supervised learning has a fundamental bottleneck: acquir-
ing large-scale, accurately labelled data is expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in many
real-world domains such as medical imaging, satellite analysis, and industrial inspection.
Assignment 02 addresses this limitation by introducing Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)—
a paradigm that learns rich visual representations from unlabelled data by constructing auxiliary
tasks from the data itself. You will implement and evaluate two state-of-the-art SSL frameworks:

- BYOL Bootstrap Your Own Latent (Grill et al., NeurIPS 2020) — a non-contrastive
    teacher–student approach that learns without negative pairs.
- DINO Self-Distillation with No Labels (Caron et al., ICCV 2021) — a self-distillation
    framework using a cross-entropy objective and a multi-crop augmentation strategy.

```
By completing this assignment you will:
```
1. Understand the theoretical foundations and architectural designs of BYOL and DINO.
2. Implement both frameworks on the Kaggle platform using the backbone from your best-
    performing Assignment 01 model.
3. Perform linear probing and k-NN evaluation to measure representation quality without fine-
    tuning.
4. Compare SSL performance against your Assignment 01 supervised baselines.
5. Produce a structured, professional lab report documenting every phase of the experiment.


### Connection to Assignment 01

```
How Assignment 02 Builds on Assignment 01
```
- Same dataset. You must use the exact same assigned dataset from Assignment 01. No
    new datasets are permitted.
- Best model as backbone. Identify the single model that achieved the highest test
    accuracy in Assignment 01 (CNN or Transformer). Extract its backbone (feature-
    extraction layers only, excluding the classification head) and use it as the encoder for
    both BYOL and DINO pre-training.
- ResNeXt is excluded. Even if ResNeXt-50 was your best-performing CNN in Assign-
    ment 01, you must not use it as the SSL backbone in this assignment. See Section 1.
    for full details and permitted alternatives.
- Unlabelled pre-training protocol. During SSL pre-training, you must discard all
    labels. Labels may only be reintroduced during linear probing and k-NN evaluation.
- Supervised baselines. The best CNN and Transformer accuracy figures from Assign-
    ment 01 serve as the performance reference for comparison in Task 4.
- Same Kaggle dataset. Re-use your group’s uploaded Kaggle dataset from Assignment
    01 as the data source.

### Architecture Restriction: ResNeXt is Not Permitted

#### IMPORTANT NOTE

```
You may NOT use the ResNeXt-50 (or any ResNeXt variant) architecture as
the backbone for SSL pre-training in this assignment.
This restriction applies regardless of whether ResNeXt achieved the best accuracy in As-
signment 01. The rationale is two-fold:
```
1. ResNeXt’s grouped convolution design interacts poorly with the very small effective
    batch sizes that arise when BYOL/DINO use multi-crop augmentation, leading to un-
    stable batch-normalisation statistics.
2. The assignment is designed to explore SSL on architectures you have not yet deeply
    analysed in Assignment 01—particularly EfficientNet and Vision Transformers.

```
If ResNeXt was your Assignment 01 top model, select the second-best model from
your results table and use that backbone instead. Permitted backbone choices are listed in
Section 1.4.
```
### Permitted Backbone Choices

The table below lists all permitted backbone encoders. Choose the one corresponding to your
best-performing non-ResNeXt model from Assignment 01.


Category Backbone Embedding Dim Notes

CNN MobileNetV3-Large 960 Lightweight; suitable for limited GPU RAM

CNN EfficientNet-B3 1536 Strong baseline; recommended for CNN track

ViT ViT-S/16 384 Recommended for DINO; native to SSL

ViT Swin-T 768 Hierarchical ViT; good transfer features

ViT DeiT-S 384 Distilled ViT; efficient and stable

ResNeXt-50 and all ResNeXt variants — PROHIBITED

```
Selection Rule
```
1. Look up your Assignment 01 results table.
2. Find the model with the highest test accuracy that is not a ResNeXt variant.
3. Use that model’s backbone (without its classification head) for both BYOL and DINO.
4. State your chosen backbone explicitly in the Global Configuration cell of your notebook
    and justify the choice in your written report.


## Theoretical Background

### Self-Supervised Learning — Core Concepts

Self-supervised learning creates pseudo-supervision automatically from the input data. For vi-
sion, the most successful family of methods uses joint-embedding architectures: two views
of the same image are encoded and the model is trained so that the embeddings are similar
irrespective of the augmentation applied.

Data Augmentation Views

Both BYOL and DINO rely on augmentation to create diverse views of the same image. Each
view is generated by randomly composing:

```
Augmentation Parameters
```
```
Random Resized Crop Area [0. 08 , 1 .0]; resized to 224 × 224
Horizontal Flip p = 0. 5
Colour Jitter Brightness, contrast, saturation, hue
Grayscale p = 0. 2
Gaussian Blur σ ∈ [0. 1 , 2 .0]
Solarization (DINO) Invert pixels above threshold, p = 0. 2
```
### BYOL — Bootstrap Your Own Latent

Architecture

BYOL uses two networks sharing the same backbone but with different update rules:

- Online network fθ: backbone → projector MLP → predictor MLP. Updated by gradient
    descent.
- Target network fξ: backbone→ projector MLP (no predictor). Updated via Exponential
    Moving Average (EMA):

```
ξ ← τ ξ + (1− τ)θ, τ ∈ [0. 996 , 1 .0]
```
Loss Function

Given two augmented views v 1 ,v 2 of the same image x:

#### LBYOL=−^12

#### 

```
qθ(v 1 )· zξ(v 2 )
∥qθ(v 1 )∥∥zξ(v 2 )∥
```
#### +

```
qθ(v 2 )· zξ(v 1 )
∥qθ(v 2 )∥∥zξ(v 1 )∥
```
#### 

The predictor and EMA target together prevent representational collapse without requiring neg-
ative pairs.

### DINO — Self-Distillation with No Labels

Architecture

DINO uses a teacher–student structure where the teacher is an EMA copy of the student:

```
θt ← λθt+ (1− λ)θs, λ follows a cosine schedule.
```

Multi-Crop Strategy

DINO generates multiple views per image:

- 2 global crops at 224 × 224 (seen by teacher and student).
- 6–10 local crops at 96 × 96 (seen only by student).

This asymmetric strategy forces the student to map local context to global semantics.

Loss Function

```
LDINO=−
```
#### X

```
x∈Vg
```
#### X

```
x′∈V
x′̸=x
```
```
Pt(x) logPs(x′)
```
where Ptand Psare the teacher and student softmax distributions with temperatures τt< τs.
A running-mean centering vector c prevents collapse.

### Evaluation Protocols

```
Protocol Description
```
```
Linear Probing Freeze the pre-trained backbone. Train a single nn.Linear layer
on labelled data. Strong accuracy indicates linearly separable
features.
k-NN Classification Extract normalised embeddings for all training images. Classify
test images by majority vote among the k nearest neighbours.
No additional training needed.
Attention Visualisation (DINO only) Overlay self-attention maps from the last ViT block
on input images to verify semantic grounding.
```

## Tasks and Deliverables

### Task 1 — Dataset Preparation and EDA (10 marks)

```
Task 1: Dataset Preparation and EDA
```
1. Reload your Assignment 01 Kaggle dataset. Display the class distribution as a bar
    chart.
2. Split the data into:
    - 80% — unlabelled SSL pre-training pool (labels discarded).
    - 10% — labelled linear probe / k-NN training set.
    - 10% — held-out test set.
3. Confirm label removal: print the shape of the unlabelled pool and assert that no
    label tensor is passed to the SSL dataloader.
4. Visualise at least 16 augmented views of a single image, showing the effect of random
    crop, colour jitter, Gaussian blur, and solarization.
5. Report: number of images per split, per-channel mean and standard deviation, and
    class balance in the labelled split.

```
Report Section: Dataset and Preprocessing (≈300–400 words)
```
```
Include: class distribution plot, augmentation visualisation grid (16 views), split statistics
table, and a brief justification of the 80/10/10 strategy.
```
### Task 2 — BYOL Pre-Training (25 marks)


```
Task 2: BYOL Implementation and Pre-Training
```
```
Backbone requirement (read carefully):
```
```
IMPORTANT NOTE
Use the backbone of your best-performing non-ResNeXt model from Assignment
01 (see Section 1.4). ResNeXt is prohibited. Initialise the backbone weights from
your saved Assignment 01 checkpoint, then replace the classification head with the
BYOL projector and predictor.
```
1. Implement the BYOL online and target networks with the following heads:
    - Projector MLP: 3 layers, BatchNorm, hidden dim = 4096, output dim = 256.
    - Predictor MLP: 2 layers, BatchNorm, hidden dim = 4096, output dim = 256.
    - EMA schedule: τ from 0. 996 → 1. 0 (cosine).
2. Use AdamW optimiser (lr = 3× 10 −^4 , weight decay = 1× 10 −^6 ).
3. Pre-train for a minimum of 100 epochs on the unlabelled pool.
4. Plot and log the BYOL loss curve (epoch vs. loss).
5. Save backbone weights as byol_backbone.pth.

```
### Task 3 — DINO Pre-Training (25 marks)

```
Task 3: DINO Implementation and Pre-Training
```
```
Backbone requirement (read carefully):
```
```
IMPORTANT NOTE
Use the same backbone chosen in Task 2. If your best model was a CNN (e.g.
EfficientNet-B3), you may use it for DINO by treating it as a plain encoder; a ViT-S/
backbone is strongly recommended for DINO because the multi-head self-attention
maps it produces enable the attention visualisation in Task 3, step 6. ResNeXt
remains prohibited.
```
1. Implement DINO with:
    - Projection head: 3-layer MLP, ℓ 2 -normalised, output dim = 65 536.
    - Multi-crop: 2 global views at 224 × 224 , 6 local views at 96 × 96.
    - Teacher EMA: λ from 0. 996 → 1. 0 (cosine).
    - Centering: running-mean vector, momentum = 0. 9.
    - Temperatures: τs= 0. 1 ; τtwarmup from 0. 04 → 0. 07.
2. Use AdamW (lr = 5× 10 −^4 , weight decay cosine from 0. 04 → 0. 4 ).
3. Pre-train for a minimum of 100 epochs on the unlabelled pool.
4. Plot and log the DINO loss curve.
5. Visualise DINO self-attention maps for at least 5 test images, overlaying the last-block
    attention on the original image.
6. Save backbone weights as dino_backbone.pth.
